I am a senior technologist of the [Language and Information Systems Group (GPLSI)](https://gplsi.dlsi.ua.es/en/home/) at the [University of Alicante](https://www.ua.es/). I am also currently collaborating on the ALIA project as a member of the [Digital Intelligence Center (CENID)](https://cenid.es/).
Furthermore, I am graduated from the Computer Engineering degree of the University of Alicante. During my undergraduate studies, I also obtained a professional degree in Music at the Professional Conservatory ‘Vila de Sant Joan’, in the specialty of Violin. 


Research Interests
======
My first research work has focused on the detection and mitigation of biases in language models. More specifically,
my work is oriented at reducing the gap in gender bias mitigation in word embeddings between English and
morphologically rich languages as Spanish.

In addition, I recently started working on the research line of quantum computing, which is gaining widespread
attention as quantum infrastructure is becoming available for scientific research. This technology has a great
potential in many fields, such as Natural Language Processing. I particularly focused on the formulation of In-
stance Selection (IS) and clustering problems as Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems.
Our research group will further develop this line into Natural Language Generation and Text Summarization
applications.
